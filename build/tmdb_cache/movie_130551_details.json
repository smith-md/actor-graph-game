  "overview": "Bebo Conforti, a well-known piano bar singer, is forced to flee in the middle of the performance, to avoid a handful of criminals who want to capture him, on the orders of the \"ferocious\" local boss, Fefè Lucanica. Monica, Fefè's young and only daughter, has just told him that she is expecting a child with him. Luckily for our chansonnier, Fefè's henchmen are anything but smart, the Boss despairs by denigrating them, but he is too fond of them to get rid of them. From this manhunt, an unusual \"On de road\" escape is unleashed, full of misunderstandings, false leads and double truths.",
