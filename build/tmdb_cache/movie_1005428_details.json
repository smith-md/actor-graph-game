The film, which is enriched with precious archive footage from the Cineteca di Bologna, including rare audio recordings and film clips shot behind the scenes, sees for the first time the direct participation of the Leone family and has interviews both with Leone\u2019s longtime collaborators and with icons of Hollywood who have been profoundly influenced by his work.", "popularity": 1.3917, "poster_path": "/aCKJgQ4pA68AadCzvGsngWQLHeV.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 176106, "logo_path": "/pvIH3cW987c4UKcKWnmq8V3nK0v.png", "name": "Leone Film Group", "origin_country": "IT"}, {"id": 135346, "logo_path": "/hIwjhVdOOQ1fpdebwOuDQD7bnw0.png", "name": "Sky Studios", "origin_country": "GB"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2022-10-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"english_name": "English", "iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"english_name": "French", "iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"english_name": "Italian", "iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Sergio Leone: The Italian Who Invented America", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.325, "vote_count": 60}
