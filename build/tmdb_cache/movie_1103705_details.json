With its, the world of film fans and martial arts cinema discovered a new idol: Jean-Claude Van Damme. In the 1970s there was Bruce Lee, but at the end of the 1980s a Belgian won the day. Van Damme was a karate master and had unparalleled strength and flexibility. For ten years he was one of Hollywood's hottest action stars. But excessive overconfidence and drugs bring him down again. At home in Europe he becomes a laughing stock on talk shows. Only with \"JCVD\" does he manage to get back on his feet, playing his character with perspective and self-irony, but without ever giving up the reputation that his action films brought him and which has been a cult for several generations. The highs and lows of his eventful life are told through archive footage and contributions from people close to the popular Belgian actor.", "popularity": 3.3678, "poster_path": "/1UrweOtMOmXGuYWIpz56sOtjDGA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 78594, "logo_path": "/nbvR0hoJUXmG0t58vGpHiDEJVYg.png", "name": "Flair Productions", "origin_country": "FR"}, {"id": 48511, "logo_path": "/s1SdauimBTWstbskDE6yu3P44yn.png", "name": "Kaos Films", "origin_country": "BE"}, {"id": 792, "logo_path": "/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png", "name": "RTBF", "origin_country": "BE"}, {"id": 16661, "logo_path": null, "name": "ARTE GEIE", "origin_country": "FR"}, {"id": 29725, "logo_path": "/6PJrEn8WR7RQzbwv6vGoEvxg6Dh.png", "name": "Hot", "origin_country": "IL"}, {"id": 67412, "logo_path": "/vgVqq5hunVs8GN5Je9d9rG7Q2NU.png", "name": "Movistar Plus+", "origin_country": "ES"}, {"id": 13668, "logo_path": "/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png", "name": "RTS", "origin_country": "CH"}, {"id": 310, "logo_path": "/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png", "name": "CNC", "origin_country": "FR"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IL", "name": "Israel"}, {"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}], "release_date": "2023-03-17", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 58, "spoken_languages": [{"english_name": "English", "iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"english_name": "French", "iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Jean-Claude van Damme: Karate King", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.276, "vote_count": 29}
