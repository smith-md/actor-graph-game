  "overview": "Sophie and Olivier are a couple leading a straightforward life. They’re bakers in Paris and their lives are regulated by the constraints of their job. Sophie gets the feeling that her husband is no longer really interested in her. They then read a personal ad pinned to their bakery’s notice board and get in touch with Paul and Colette, a rather strange couple who want to sell their holiday home. They buy the house – without even taking a look at it first – little knowing that it’s located in a nudist colony.",
