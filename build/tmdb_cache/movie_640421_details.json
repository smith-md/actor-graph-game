These Cargos are people who have just died on Earth and we learn that Prahastha works for Post Death Transition Services — a large, pioneering, bureaucratic company that stores, transitions, and recycles dead people for rebirth. Today, after many years, a young, popular astronaut — Yuvishka, trained in cutting edge technology, will join the spaceship as his assistant.",
