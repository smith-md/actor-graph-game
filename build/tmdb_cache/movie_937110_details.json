With business going downhill, she is forced to work with a professional restaurant consultant, Ben, to see if they can turn things around. At first, Elizabeth resists the changes Ben believes will save the restaurant, but as they get closer, Elizabeth realizes that not all change is bad. She rediscovers her passion for baking and might even open her heart to new love.",
