Years later, Vijay has grown up and has joined the police force as an Inspector. Unlike his dad, he is corrupt and does accept bribes to turn a nelson's eye to crime. The City Police are assigned the task of apprehending a customed man called \"Shahenshah\", who operates at night and targets, tries and kills gangsters in a \"Judge and Executioner \"style. No one knows the real identity of Shahenshah, as he is feared by the police department, and respected by the poor and middle-class.",
