Hoffman shows an obvious distaste for money politics and the conservative right. He looks seedier and more disillusioned the campaign progresses. Eventually Hoffman seems most energized by the Ralph Nader campaign as an alternative to the nearly indistinguishable major parties. The high point of the film are the comments by Barney Frank who says that marches and demonstrations are largely a waste of time, and that the really effective political players such as the NRA and the AARP never bother with walk ins, sit-ins, shoot-ins or shuffles. In the interview with Jesse Jackson, Hoffman is too flustered to ask all of his questions.", "popularity": 0.328, "poster_path": "/7MTdoGNXuOffq08tRTmUsO0K2yB.jpg", "release_date": "2001-11-02", "title": "Last Party 2000", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 10, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "6709e1df576497fbd05a4693", "order": 48}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 1425459, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Iron Man 3 Unmasked", "overview": "Making of Iron man 3", "popularity": 0.1929, "poster_path": "/miJfepD8MqNBmWs4w6PH08hvSyZ.jpg", "release_date": "2013-08-24", "title": "Iron Man 3 Unmasked", "video": true, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "67997154b4b6f91453a968d6", "order": 2}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99, 10770], "id": 1476870, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Biography: Val Kilmer", "overview": "A&E's Biography of Val Kilmer.", "popularity": 3.034, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "2004-11-17", "title": "Biography: Val Kilmer", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "681abc5ba5232f8b3cc697b4", "order": 3}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 596552, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Weight of the Line: Animation Tales", "overview": "A behind-the scenes look at the grueling one-year process of transferring the filmed images into the unique animation style featured in the final version of the movie 'A Scanner Darkly'.", "popularity": 1.9926, "poster_path": "/9ZxVeTyv2RBJhmKXphOEhO5JA6o.jpg", "release_date": "2006-12-19", "title": "The Weight of the Line: Animation Tales", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "683f8861a63c464c00f2bf1b", "order": 3}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 710155, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Linklater: St. Richard of Austin", "overview": "Ben Lewis spends time with Richard Linklater, the highly-respected director of 'Slacker', 'School of Rock', and 'Before Sunset', along with some of the stars of his films.
