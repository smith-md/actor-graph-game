Unlike the wishes of her husband, In-gyu, who has a business running resorts, they don't have a child yet. They've tried test tubes and home remedies, but nothing has worked.  Her husband and her in-laws finally decide to get a surrogate mother, and Min-ji has no choice but to agree to it, as she is worn out from their pressure. Hometown friend Jeong-ah comes knocking on the door. Min-ji is uneasy with Jeong-ah around, as she knows her past secrets, including the time she lived with someone else and had an abortion. On the other hand, In-gyu has completely fallen for bold and sexy Jeong-ah. Like a crow that nests in another's nest, Jeong-ah takes over Min-ji's place slowly and gradually. Min-ji is driven into a corner, so she meets Jeong-ah's husband, Joo-sik, to stop her. However, she falls for his trap and is used to replace his wife who ran away from home.", "popularity": 3.1125, "poster_path": "/Aol6g6M4YlvE2GPPcmiP6zb9ZWT.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "KR", "name": "South Korea"}], "release_date": "2019-12-03", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 70, "spoken_languages": [{"english_name": "Korean", "iso_639_1": "ko", "name": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4/\uc870\uc120\ub9d0"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "I Have Two Wives", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 2}
