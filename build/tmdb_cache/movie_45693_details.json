  "overview": "Instead of really living her life since losing her mother at age 7, Seattle lawyer Amy Myer sticks to a foolproof 'timeline' her mother drew as a guideline to help plot the course of her life. The timeline, which proves to be accurate in all other respects, predicts that Amy should marry her seventh boyfriend. However, Amy must question her instincts when she feels that her sixth boyfriend is the one she should marry, not the predicted seventh. Now she must decide whether to follow her mother's advice, or follow her own heart.",
